This directory contains the code to handle Open Street
Map, Leaflet, OpenLayers und Postgresql/PostGIS plus CouchDB with
GeoCouch.

A very short installation gist is available here:

https://gist.github.com/Su-Shee/5482142
https://gist.github.com/Su-Shee/5501593


A couple of additional R modules are required - install as usal on R's
shell:

install.packages('ggmap')
install.packages('mapproj')

and just call the resulting plot.

The Leaflet example can be opened in your browser; all JavaScript
libraries are served via their CDN (LeafLet, Open Street Map API)

To import OSM data into GeoCouch you also need this Ruby gem:

gem install shp2geocouch

and this OSM-to-PostGIS tool:

https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql

The directory preprocessing/cleanups contains a Perl and Python script
to clean up the data and to poll Open Street Map's API.

THE RESULT IS ALREADY AVAILABLE AS JSON AND CSV!

You don't have to poll the API all over again.

In addition, you should install two Perl modules:

cpan WWW::Mechanize
cpan URI::Escape

and its Python sister:

pip install requests
